					<p>Current Chase Bank employee who is looking for new challenge by changing his career to from financial to more technical role.</p>
					
					<br>
					
					<p>Originally, I'm from Ukraine , and I'm in Houston for about 6-7 years. The biggest thing I like about States is a lot of opportunities for people who willing to work hard want to realize themselves. The same relates to Houston. I love big cities ! Big city = big opportunities , a lot of things to do , big chances to find people with a same mindset and interests. Almost forgot to mention food. There are a lot of restaurants here . If you will try to visit new restaurant in which you never went before every day, it would take you few decades to visit them all in Houston. My biggest complaints about Houston are the heat and humidity that following you 6 months a year . 
					</p>
			
					<br>
			
					<p>    This is not my final bio.At this moment I don't know what to write ,but I will definetly upgrade it later after going into the course more deeply.
